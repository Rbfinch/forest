# forest

A tool that analyses the structure of a Rust project and generates a tree-like representation of its modules, functions, and types.
It provides a command-line interface to visualize the hierarchy and relationships between different components of the codebase.
It can be useful for understanding the organization of a Rust project, especially in larger codebases.
